# Domain Verification Guide for Resend

## Why Domain Verification Matters

To prevent emails from landing in spam folders and improve deliverability, you need to verify your domain (`jimsclipboard.com`) in Resend.

## Current Email Configuration

Your emails are already configured to send from:
- **From Address**: `noreply@jimsclipboard.com`
- **From Name**: `Jim's Clipboard`

## Steps to Verify Domain in Resend

### 1. Access Resend Dashboard

### 2. Add Your Domain
1. Click **Add Domain**
2. Enter: `jimsclipboard.com`
3. Click **Add Domain**

### 3. Configure DNS Records
Resend will provide you with DNS records to add to your domain registrar. You'll need to add:

#### Required DNS Records:
- **SPF Record** (TXT): `v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all`
- **DKIM Record** (CNAME): `resend._domainkey.jimsclipboard.com`

### 4. Verify Domain
1. Add the DNS records to your domain registrar
2. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
3. Return to Resend dashboard
4. Click **Verify** on your domain

### 5. Test Email Delivery
1. Use the email test page at `/email-test`
2. Send test emails to verify they're not going to spam
3. Check both inbox and spam folder
